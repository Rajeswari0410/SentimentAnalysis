#### Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Model on Yelp Review Dataset:

- Description: A specialized project focusing on sentiment analysis using a transformer model implemented from scratch. The objective is to classify textual reviews from the Yelp dataset into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. The project aims to leverage the capabilities of transformer architectures to capture intricate patterns and nuances in the review text, enabling accurate sentiment classification.

- Dataset: Yelp review dataset

- Technologies: Python, Google Colab

- Key Features:
  - Developed a transformer model from scratch tailored for sentiment analysis tasks.
  - Preprocessed and tokenized the Yelp review dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
  - Conducted rigorous evaluations using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance across the three sentiment categories.
  - Provided insights into the model's ability to capture and classify sentiment based on the review text, highlighting potential applications and future enhancements.

By leveraging transformer architectures and the Yelp review dataset, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in effectively analyzing and classifying sentiment in textual data.
